# Digital Signal Processing Using MATLAB
---
## This repo consists programs made on MATLAB for digital signal processing (DSP) undergraduate course. 

#### Basic Signals folder has 6 basic signals along with their graphs in both continuous and discrete form. 
1. Unit step (**heaviside**) 
2. Unit ramp 
3. Sine wave
4. Unit Impulse
5. Decaying Exponential  
6. Random Noise

#### Given below are examples of the graphs in this repo.
